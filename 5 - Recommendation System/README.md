### - Objective -
The goal of the task is to increase profits (by 20%) by selling additional products on the online store platform. The available files include a dataset with historical events on the platform, hashed product property data and a category tree. To solve the problem the data were analyzed, processed and prepared for ML models. Six models were involved in the experiments.

### - Expected result -
Recommendation system with a MAP@K metric result of at least 20%. Cold Start Strategy. A web service for providing recommendations to the user. 

### - Technical tasks -
- Data analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
